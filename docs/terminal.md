## Use

The terminal can be found in the [`options`](menu.md) menu.

**This terminal is for the game only, it will not run local commands.**

## Help command

As of right now, **there is no help command**. It's coming I promise!

## Access

The terminal only has access to certain game mechanics at the moment. Why? Because this is techincally a hack, if you had access to every mechanic, you'd be invincible. That's no fun.

**The terminal has access to limited inventory functions.** Check below to see what you can do.

## Full list of commands

### `cls`

Clear the screen.

### `exit`

Exit the **in-game** terminal. **This will not exit the game.**

### `inventory has {...}`

Find whether the player has a certian item in their inventory.

### `inventory hasType {...}`

Find whether the player has a certain item type in their inventory.

### `inventory clean`

Cleans the inventory. **You'll have to check some later docs on what this means.**
