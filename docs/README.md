# PATH

PATH is a console game. That means there are **no graphics**. It's just simple code run in the terminal.

## Intro

In this documentation (& wiki), you may see the words "biome" and "environment" listed many times. **These words mean the same thing.** "Biome" is a little more user friendly, while "environment" is the technical term.

## Getting started

This documentation is just a list of various features in the game. You only will really need to go the [install](install.md) page. That gets you started on your journey. (**PLEASE CHECK THE REQUIREMENTS**)

## All resources

Incase you want to skip the guide, you can browse any topic.

- [Biomes](biomes.md)
- [Commands](commands.md)
- [Errors](errors.md)
- [Installation](install.md)
- [Items](items.md)
- [Menues](menu.md)
- [Mobs](mobs.md)
- [Terminal](terminal.md)

**However, if you're a nerd**, you can view development documentation. These docs are mostly meant for  myself (the creator).
