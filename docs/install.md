# Installation

There's not much in this doc.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Next steps](#next-steps)

Check the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/cmexdev/PATH/releases) and select the most recent release. Once done, download the setup `.exe`. **This guide assumes you will not need assistance on the installer.** (It's pretty straight forward).

After you've completed this, you should've successfully installed PATH!
