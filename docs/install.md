## Requirements

- **NodeJS** (**THIS ONE IS *VERY* IMPORTANT!!! YOU ABSOLUTELY MUST HAVE THIS INSTALLED**. Visit [NodeJS.org](https://nodejs.org) to install it.)
- Not even a gigabyte of RAM. (*you'll probably have enough*)
- **Windows 10** (edition doesn't matter & working on MacOS and Linux version?)
- You should have a couple of gigabytes of storage set aside for this game. (*it's a **really** small game*)

## Install

Check the GitHub [releases](https://github.com/cmexdev/PATH/releases) and select the most recent release. Once done, download the setup `.exe`. **This guide assumes you will not need assistance on the installer.** (It's pretty straight forward).

After you've completed this, you should've successfully installed PATH!
